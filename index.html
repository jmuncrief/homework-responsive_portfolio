                <p>I'm a student living in Albuquerque, NM. I came from a career in Information Technology. I started as
                    a service desk analyst for a government/military contractor, and held that position for a year.
                    Then, I was moved into management over that same desk. I managed the desk for close to two years,
                    overseeing a team of two-dozen analysts working three seperate contracts. It was in this role I
                    started scripting many of my day-to-day functions, and introuducing myself to the work of coding. By
                    the time I left my position as manager, I had written 20-30 scripts to automate tasks for myself and
                    my employees. Productivity skyrocketed. Eventually, I moved out of that position (and out of
                    management alltogether) to pursue an opportunity in another division of my company. This new role,
                    while different, did not present me with the technical challenges I wanted to face in my day-to-day;
                    it was boring. After six months, I resigned.

                <p>Now I work sales and service in a bicycle shop here in Albuquerque. The environment is relaxed,
                    there's ample time for chit-chat, and the schedule is flexible enough to allow me to pursue my
                    technical interests.
